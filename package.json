	"description": "- Web-based framework for environment-aware rendering and interaction in augmented reality based on [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) - The framework implements realistic rendering of 3D objects, handles with geometry occlusions, matches the lighting of the environment, casts shadows, and provides physics interaction with real-world objects. - Target the web environment and have designed our solution to work on a vast range of devices as, monocular camera setups or devices with dedicated higher quality depth sensors. - Single application while being capable of obtaining over 20 frames per second even on middle-range devices. - [Demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6-eCIkYRuA) of the features in the framework. - Based on the experimental [WebXR AR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-ar-module/) draft  API available in Chrome 88+   - [Lighting Estimation](https://immersive-web.github.io/lighting-estimation/)   - [Depth Sensing Module](https://immersive-web.github.io/depth-sensing/)   - [Hit Test Module](https://immersive-web.github.io/hit-test/)",
